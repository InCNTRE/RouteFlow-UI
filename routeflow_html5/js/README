Usage dependencies
===============================================================================

To use Cytoscape Web in your HTML document, you must include the following JS:

  * jQuery 1.3.2 or 1.7.1 (or newer)
	
  * One of
	
    * jquery.cytoscapeweb[.min].js
		    
      Either the minified or unminified Cytoscape Web code WITHOUT ANY
      dependencies.  When using this file, you must include the
      appropriate dependencies in the `lib` directory in your HTML file.

      You'll need the dependencies of the SVG renderer.
		    
      SVG renderer dependencies (found in the `lib` directory)
        * 2D.js
        * jquery.color.js
        * jquery.mousewheel.js
        * jquery.svg.js
		
    * jquery.cytoscapeweb.all[.min].js
		    
        Either the minified or unminified Cytoscape Web code WITH ALL
        dependencies.  When using this file, you do not need to include
        any of the dependencies for the SVG renderer.


We'd like to thank the academy...
===============================================================================

A big thanks goes out to Keith Wood for his jQuery SVG library, which is used
in Cytoscape Web's default SVG renderer implementation.  You can find out more
about his library at his website (http://keith-wood.name/svg.html).

We would also like to thank Mark Gibson for his work on the jQuery color
library, which is used in our continuous mapper calculations.  You can find out
more about Mark's library at his website
(http://www.adaptavist.com/display/jQuery/Colour+Library).

We used Kevin Lindsey's SVG intersection library to calculate the positioning
of some objects, like edges.  You can find his library at his website
(http://www.kevlindev.com/gui/math/intersection).

We used Brandon Aaron's mouse wheel library for providing easy cross-browser
support for zooming with the mouse wheel in the SVG renderer.  You can find out
more about his library at his website (http://brandonaaron.net).

Arbor was used in one of Cytoscape Web's included layouts.  We made some
modifications to the library, written by Samizdat Drafting Co., so that it
would work with multiple instances of Cytoscape Web and that it would work
on lesser browsers, like IE.  Information about this library can be found
at the Arbor website (http://arborjs.org/) and on GitHub
(https://github.com/maxkfranz/arbor) where the original code was forked.


Build dependencies
===============================================================================

You need a number of executables installed on your system to successfully run
`make` to build the project.
	
Their paths are defined in `Makefile`, so you can revise the paths to these
executables and still run `make` successfully.  You should be able to run
`make` without modification on any well configured Unix-like machine, such as
Linux or Mac OS X---Mac needs XCode with command line tools installed to run
`make`.



Build instructions
===============================================================================

Run `make` in the console.  The targets are:

  all : build everything (default)
  minify : build the production minified JS
  zip : minify and make a ZIP file for release
  clean : deletes built files

A note to developers:

For `zip`, make sure to define `VERSION` in `Makefile` if you're making an
actual release ZIP.



Tests
===============================================================================

QUnit tests are found in the `tests` directory.  Each HTML file shares the
test suite but redefines which JS files are used.  In this way, you can test
with different versions of jQuery or different falvours of the library
(minified, plain, or combined and minified).
